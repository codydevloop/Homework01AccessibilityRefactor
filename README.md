# Homework01AccessibilityRefactor

Task -

Refactor the code base to make it web accessible.  Along the way, clean up the code by eliminating redundancy, implementing new HTML semantic tags, and adding appropriate comments to improve readability for the future.

Lessons learned -

This was a great project for a Jr. developer.  It forced me to get intimate with the HTML and CSS code.  The major take away for me was increasing my knowlege of how HTML elements are structured by default and how you can implement CSS to manipulate those default layout properties.
